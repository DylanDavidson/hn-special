# HN Special â€” A Hacker News extension
A theme and extension for [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) that improves the look and feel and adds some interesting features.

The available features can be enabled or disabled based on your personal preference. New feature contributions are welcome!

You can install the original extension [from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hn-special-an-addition-to/cchaceegbflphbdpfocjalgjhjoahiia).

You can install this fork by cloning the repository and using the extension unpacked.
Open up your terminal, go to the directory you want the extension stored, and run the following:
```
git clone git@github.com:DylanDavidson/hn-special.git
```
Then go into Chrome and type `chrome://extensions/` into the search bar.

From here click `Load unpacked extension...` and find the folder that you cloned this repo to and open it.

Now this fork of the `hn-special` extension should be running! Be sure to disable the original extension if you have it so they don't clash.

## This Fork
This fork adds some feautures that were left off of the chrome extension, since it is no longer actively contributed to.
Currently it adds:
